"""
Weaviate cluster topology for the feasibility study (issue #41).

Deliberately mirrors `../cross_system_replication/qdrant_topology.py`'s shape
-- module-level constants, a generated compose file under a run directory,
fixed host ports, and small HTTP helpers -- so a reader who knows the Qdrant
harness can follow this one by its differences.

The differences that matter:

  * Weaviate clusters via a Raft-backed metadata store (RAFT_JOIN /
    RAFT_BOOTSTRAP_EXPECT) plus gossip on 7946, rather than Qdrant's single
    --bootstrap URI.
  * Replication is a per-class property (`replicationConfig.factor`), set at
    class creation, not a collection-creation parameter alongside shards.
  * ASYNC_REPLICATION is opt-in per class in v1.29+; the whole point of
    testing Weaviate is that this exists, so the class turns it on and the
    image is digest-pinned, because a feasibility verdict on one version is
    not one on another (#41 Confounds).

One shard, replication factor 3, three nodes: the smallest topology in which
"what does replica N hold" is a question. Matching Qdrant's 2x3 is not
required for a feasibility verdict and is not attempted here.
